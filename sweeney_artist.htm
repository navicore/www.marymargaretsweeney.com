            Margaret Sweeney uses the medium of etching in its best traditional 
            manner. Proficient and sophisticated in technique, her prints have 
            the poise and polish of the Old Masters or the nine-teenth-century 
            Etching Revivalists. Indeed the artist confesses the influence of 
            the prints of Childe Hassam. Like this nineteenth century American 
            Impressionist, Sweeney is continually inspired by the New England 
            Landscape. With her eyes attuned to the linear vocabulary of etching 
            she finds patterns everywhere in rocks, trees and uneven horizons. 
            While many of her prints depict figures, still lifes, and interiors, 
            she always returns to her favorite forested landscapes." - David Acton, 
            Working Proof.<br>
            <br>
            Sweeney attended The Chicago Art Institute majoring in advertising 
            and design but only found printmaking when she returned to formal 
            art training after raising her children. She graduated from the University 
            of New Hapmpshire in 1980 and has worked as a printmaker for the past 
            29 years. She is presently a member of Experimental Etching Studio 
            in Boston. She is also a juried member of Boston Printmakers, Society 
            of American Graphic Artists, New York, New Hampshire Art Association 
            and League of New Hampshire Craftsmen. <br>
            <br>
            Her works have been exhibited nationally and internationally and are 
            in the permanent collections of the New Hampshire Commission on the 
            Arts, Boston Public Library, Worcester Art Museum, The Art Complex 
            Museum, Duxbury, MA and Framingham State College. </font> </td>
